This repository contains the code and analysis for a customer churn prediction project for ConnectTel, a telecommunications company. The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model to identify customers at risk of churning (canceling their service).
## Project Overview
•	Problem: ConnectTel is facing significant customer churn, leading to revenue loss and decreased market share. Current retention strategies lack effectiveness.
•	Solution: Build a customer churn prediction system using machine learning to proactively identify at-risk customers.
•	Benefits:
o	Reduced customer churn
o	Improved customer retention strategies
o	Enhanced competitive edge
## Methodology
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Analyzed customer data using Python libraries (e.g., pandas) to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with churn.
o	Identified key factors influencing customer churn through visualizations (scatter plots, boxplots) and correlation analysis.
2.	Data Preprocessing:
o	Encoded categorical variables (e.g., gender) using one-hot encoding for machine learning compatibility.
o	Handled missing values by removing details for 11 customers with missing total charges details.
3.	Model Building and Evaluation:
o	Trained and tested three supervised learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict customer churn.
o	Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
o	Selected the model that best aligns with ConnectTel's business goals (considering the trade-off between false positives and false negatives).
## Deliverables
•	Jupyter Notebook: Documents the entire project workflow, including code, data analysis, visualizations, and model evaluation results.
## Next Steps
•	Perform optimization of the model to improve churn prediction.
•	Integrate the chosen model into ConnectTel's system for real-time churn prediction.
•	Develop targeted retention strategies based on churn risk scores generated by the model.
•	Continuously monitor model performance and retrain as needed to maintain effectiveness.
